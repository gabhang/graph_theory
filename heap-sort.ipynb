    "### Introduction\n",
    "Heap Sort is a very *efficient* and widely used **sorting algorithm** that uses a **heap** *data structure*. However, it might be *unstable* as actions in the heap might modify the relative order of equivalent keys. \n",

    "Reference: __[Heap Sort](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2019/COMP26120/SortingTool/heap_sort_info.html)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap sort can also be thought of as a ***more advanced version*** of **binary trees**. Instead of *building nodes*, it *generates a heap* by *altering the position of elements* in the array itself.\n",

    "- **Root**: The one and only, located at the top of the tree.\n",
    "- **Parent Node**: Any nodes (excluding the root) that has at least one child node (sub-node).\n",
    "- **Child Node**: A sub-node that is connected by an edge from a parent node\n",

    "In a *complete binary tree*, every level **has to be filled with nodes**, except the *lowest level* of the tree. However, it is vital to note that **any nodes at the lowest level of the tree must lean to the** ***left*** in order to be a *complete binary tree* as shown in the diagram above. Without any gaps between nodes, the tree will be **balanced** and therefore, allow heap to be represented efficiently in an array.\n",
