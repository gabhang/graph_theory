    "Heap Sort is a very *efficient* and widely used **sorting algorithm** that uses a **heap** *data structure*. However, it might be *unstable* as actions in the heap might modify the relative order of equivalent keys. \n",

    "### Heapify Function\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated above, the complete binary tree needs to be *modified into a Max-Heap* to implement heap sort. This modification process can be known as **heapify** or **heapification**. The heapify function will alter the root node to its position to ensure Max-Heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve Max-Heap, there are two approaches:\n",
    "1. **Sift up**: A child node swaps with its parent if the parent is smaller than it, therefore moving/sifting up the tree\n",
    "2. **Sift down**: A parent node (including the root node) swaps with its smaller child while moving/sifting down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interestingly to note that heapify **only** ***uses sift down approach***. In the scenario where *all nodes have to be swapped*, **sift up** approach will start checking and swapping from the *leaf nodes* while **sift down** approach will start from the *root node*. As a result, sift down approach will be ***more effective*** as it will not need to check the leaf nodes at the lowest level. \n",
