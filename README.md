# Graph Theory
***
This repository serves a project assessment for a third year software development module, Graph Theory, in Atlantic Technological University. This module introduces the basic concepts and applications of graph theory and the properties of graphs. In addition to that, graphs are used and implemented to solve complex problems. In this assessment, Heap Sort and Graph Isomorphism Problem will be discussed in depth, breaking down into several sections with the help of graph theory.

# Topics Discussed
***
## Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a heap data structure. A heap has to be a complete binary tree and a Max-Heap to be sorted. Heap sort removes the largest node repeatedly to sort the tree which will be explained thoroughly in the heap sort notebook.

## Graph Isomorphism Problem
Graph Isomorphism Problem is a complex problem which yet not known to be solvable in polynomial time. For two graphs to be isomorphic, they need to have the same number of edges, vertices as well as the same connectivity between edges. One graph can be thought of as a distorted result of another. A brute force approach has been used to determine isomorphism between two graphs in the graph isomorphism notebook.
