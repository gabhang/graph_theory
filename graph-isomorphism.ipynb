    "A graph can exist in differerent forms. Isomorphic graphs are graphs that have the same number of edges, vertices and same connectivity between edges. If two graphs have the same number of vertices and edges, plus, having the same connectivity, they are isomorphic. One can think of one graph as a distorted result of another\n",

    "When two graphs are ***isomorphic***, one of the criteria is that there is a **bijection**, which is also known as **bijective funtion**, between them. It is a function where two graphs have exactly ***one-to-one (injective)*** and ***onto (surjective)*** relationship with each other. \n",

On the other hand, **surjective** means that ***every elements in B*** gets covered by the mapping **at least once**.
