    "A graph can exist in differerent forms. Isomorphic graphs are graphs that have the same number of edges, vertices and same connectivity between edges. If two graphs have the same number of vertices and edges, plus, having the same connectivity, they are isomorphic. One can think of one graph as a distorted result of another"
