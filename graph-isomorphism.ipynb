    "A graph can exist in *differerent forms*. **Isomorphic graphs** are graphs that have the ***same number of edges, vertices and same connectivity between edges***. If two graphs have the ***same number of vertices and edges***, plus, having the ***same connectivity***, they are **isomorphic**. One can think of one graph as a *distorted result* of another.\n",
